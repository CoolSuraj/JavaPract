## Getting Started

Welcome to this practice session here . here we have practiced about abstract classes and overriding  please run App.java which can be used for all three problems

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

please add required dependency (as required)
Comments and Suggestions are welcome..

Thanks.

Problem statement

1. Create a abstract class A.
Inside A write abstract function display().
Inside A write non-abstract function show().
Write class B that inherites A.
Override display.
Create an object of B and call the functions.


2. Create a abstract class MathOp that contains four abstract methods
 addition1, subtraction1, multiplication1, divition1 and two variables.
Now create another class A which extends MathOp.
 Now override the methods and call the methods from main function.




3. Create an abstract class Motorcycle. It have a abstract function 'start'. 
It also have a non-abstract funtion have_tyres. Print "I have two tyres.".
 Next, create two classes old_bike and new_bike. Both extends class Motorcycle.
 In starts function of old_bike, print 'I start with kick.'
 In starts function of old_bike, print 'I have self start.'
 Call functions from main.
