## Getting Started

Please Go to the package name and run Runner class to get Desired output

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
  and packages are com.pract.neel.
  1. automobile 
  2. complex
  3. shape
  4. mathOP
  5. hacked

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).


1. (a) Take a class Automobile that has attributes no_wheels, no_mirror, gear and methods run, break, change_direction.
(b) Create class Toto that inherited Automobile. Change the attribute values and method bodies.
(c) Create class 'twowheeler'. Change the attribute values and method bodies.
(d) Create a class cycle inheriting twowheeler. Change the attribute values and method bodies.
(e) Create a class motorcycle inheriting twowheeler. Change the attribute values and method bodies.




Now create the main function in a different class. Next, create objects for all classes. Run every function and call attributes. 
Next, use upcasting and show the results of all the functions and attributes.




2. (a) Create a class A. Next, take two integer variables a and b. Write functions to perform addition and subtraction. 
(b) Create a class Complex_A which inherites from class A. Next, update the same variables and methods to perform in complex numbers.




3. Take a class called shape. It has some basic methods like area, periphery. It has a variable called PI = 3.14.
Create child classes like rectangle, circle inheriting shape. Update the methods area, periphery. Use PI to calculate the area of the circle.
Next, create a square class inheriting the class rectangle. Now, in the main function create the objects of all the classes and print the necessary values.


4. Create a class mathOP. It shall contain sum, subtract. The program should be such that it can add two numbers, three numbers. The sum should be able to add complex numbers. Similarly, the subtract function should able to subtract complex and real numbers. 


5. Create a class called Programmer. Inside programmer write a function called display. Inside display function, write "The original code".
Now, create a class named Hacker which extends Programar. Overwrite display. Inside the overwritten function display write "Your code is hacked".
Write the function in such a way that the hacker can not overwrite the function.




Note: You may additionally add necessary variable(s)/method(s) as necessary.
